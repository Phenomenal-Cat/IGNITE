Guide Tube Preparation
============================


Polyamide guide tubes are recommended for use with microwire brush array (MBA) electrodes, for several reasons. While this material was initially selected for its MR-compatibility and resistance to chemical and heat sterilization processes, the mechanical flexibility of polyamide matches well with that of the MBAs. This allows both the guide tube and the electrode shaft some degree of movement with the brain tissue relative to the skull, which is beleived to contribute to the improved longitudinal stability of neuronal signal isolation.

The standard 64-channel `MicroPorbes MBA electrode <https://microprobes.com/products/multichannel-arrays/mba>`_ typically has a shaft diameter of XXX μm. However, in order to isolate a broader population of neurons (believed to be located within an approximately 800μm diameter), it is necessary for the 'brush' bundle electrode tips to splay out through tissue. This requires careful manual 'pre-splaying' of the exposed microwire tips, which

Tools
=========

- Optical magnification: for working with small components, such as a workbench-mounted magnifying lamp or head-mounted loupes glasses.
- A sturdy metal ruler with metric scale
- A fine-tipped permanent ink pen for marking cut points (e.g. Sakura Micron pens)
- Micro scissors or 'Vannas' scissors: for making clean cuts through polyamide microtubing (e.g. `Roboz surgical RS-5610 <https://shopping.roboz.com/micro-scissors-micro-forceps-groups/Vannas/Vannas-Spring-Scissors-3.5in-3X0-15mm-Straight>`)
- Super glue,
- Grinding and sanding tools such as a Dremel with sanding disks, jewelers files, and sand paper.
- A plastic storage organizer box for separating and storing parts before sterilization
